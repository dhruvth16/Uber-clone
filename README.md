This guide explains how to test the functionality of the website by simulating interactions between a user and a captain. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth testing experience.

## Testing Steps

1. **Open the Website in Two Different Browsers**
   - Launch the website URL in two different web browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox).

2. **Login as User and Captain**
   - In the first browser, log in as a **user**.

   - Ensure the distance between the source and destination is between **1 to 5 kilometers** for proper functionality.

4. **Observe Real-Time Updates**
   - Perform actions as both the user and the captain in their respective browsers.
   - Verify that any updates made by the captain (e.g., location changes) are reflected in real-time for the user.
